Translational Models for Cancers

General purpose is to model translational control exerted on 
gene expression in the NCI60 panel. Translational control is
expected to uncouple mRNA values from protein values.  

'data.rda' includes initial data: 'biomart' has Ensembl Biomart v75 genomic coordinates; 'rna' has the NCI60 RNA processed data.
'annotation.rda' saves the assignment of genomic coordinates to genes profiles in the NCI60 panel at either mRNA or protein level. 
'gRanges.rna.rda' saves the genomic ranges for mRNA data; metadata are gene RNA expression values in the NCI60 cell lines 

'annotation.R' returns 'annotation.rda'
'gRanges.rna.R' returns 'gRanges.rna.rda'
